# Packet-tracing
App for packet tracing
Making for college project

Some details:
Working only with IPv4 addresses

The app sending ICMP packets to the destination,
at the beginning with TTL=1 , and after every 
attempt we increase the value by 1.

You can send directly to IP address, or you have also
option for entering a domain name.

You can change some values like max TTL ...

You will get information about the RTT,
the IP addresses of the routers, and also
get the host name of the routers if they are available

You can turn on and off the host name part, if you turn off
than the app will be significantly  faster.

You can use that app like this, or you can add stuff, do whatever you want.
